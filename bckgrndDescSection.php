<p id="bckDescription">Villa Fely's Garden  was named after the owner, Fely Cabautan. The resort used to be just a rest house for the whole family. 
        They used  to go there on weekends and have family bonding - picnic, gardening, story telling, etc. Fely started with small projects, one area after another. 
        Little by little, the place evolved from a simple resthouse to a beautiful paradise. 
        The family then started to invite friends over. 
        They celebrated and hosted parties at the rest house (Birthday Parties, Class Outings, Comapny Outings, etc.). Friends and relatives got to learn about the garden. 
        They held their own parties in there too. <br /><br /><br />
                                    Friends of friends and relatives started asking if the place is for rent and if they could rent it.  
 This gave Fely the idea of having the resthouse rented. 
 Together with her family, Fely developed the place more. 
 She had a fountain and swimming pool built, bought a videoke machine, and added more rooms for the guests.Villa Fely's Garden offers you privacy, space, and tranquility to make your holiday a relaxed and enjoyable experience.
